#Sorting algorithms & Big O
This project is used to sort array or list of elements according to a comparision operator on the elements.

## 0. Bubble Sort

| Task | Description | Prototype | Expected Output |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0. Bubble Sort | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm. | `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements. |
| 1. Insertion Sort | Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm. | `void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);` | You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements. |
| 2. Selection Sort | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm. | `void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements. |
| 3. Quick Sort | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm. | `void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements. |
| 4. Shell Sort - Knuth Sequence | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence. | `void shell_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print the array each time you decrease the interval. |
| 5. Cocktail Shaker Sort | Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm. | `void cocktail_sort_list(listint_t **list);` | You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements. |
| 6. Counting Sort | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm. | `void counting_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print your counting array once it is set up. |
| 7. Merge Sort | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge sort algorithm. | `void merge_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements. |
| 8. Heap Sort | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm. | `void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements. |
| 9. Radix Sort | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm. | `void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | |
| 10. Bitonic Sort | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bitonic sort algorithm. | `void bitonic_sort(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print the array each time you swap two elements. |
| 11. Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme | Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm with Hoare partition scheme. | `void quick_sort_hoare(int *array, size_t size);` | You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements. |
